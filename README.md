# Using Multidimensional Scaling for Grouping Social Media Influencers

This project applies **Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)** to analyze and group social media influencers based on various characteristics and metrics such as engagement rate, follower count, content type, and audience demographics. The goal is to visualize the influencers in a lower-dimensional space, making it easier to identify patterns, similarities, and groupings among them.

### Key Features:
- **Data Processing:** Preprocessing of influencer data including normalization and transformation for MDS compatibility.
- **MDS Visualization:** Visual representation of influencers in 2D/3D space based on their similarities.
- **Grouping and Clustering:** Analysis of the resulting MDS plots to identify natural groupings or clusters of influencers.
- **Insights:** Provides insights into influencer strategies and content categories that appeal to different audience segments.

### Technologies Used:
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) for dimensionality reduction

### Applications:
- **Brand Marketing:** Helps brands identify influencers who share similar audience profiles.
- **Campaign Strategy:** Assists in selecting diverse influencer groups to maximize campaign reach and impact.
